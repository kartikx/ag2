Waldiez is an open-source workflow tool that lets you orchestrate your LLM-agents using drag-and-drop and develop complex agentic applications.  It is a low-code tool that assists you design and visualize your multi-agent workflow in jupyter lab as a plugin. Wadiez runs over AG2 supporting all the communication patterns (e.g., sequential, nested and group chat), supporting several LLM-based services offered by OpenAI, Anthropic, NVIDIA NIM, local hosted models and several others.  In this talk, we\u2019ll dive into the powerful features of Wadiez, demonstrating its capabilities through real-world use cases. Join us as we explore how Wadiez can streamline complex workflows and enhance multi-agent interactions, showcasing exactly what sets it apart from other LLM-based orchestration tools.\\n\\n### Sign Up: https://discord.gg/NrNP5ZAx?event=1308233315442098197\\n\\n## Transforming CRM with Agents: The Journey to Ully.ai\'s Next-Gen ERP - Dec 16, 2024\\n\\n### Speakers: Bassil Khilo\\n\\n### Biography of the speakers:\\n\\nBassil Khilo is the Founder & CEO of Ully.ai, an AI-powered CRM platform that automates lead research and outreach while offering full-cycle sales management tools.

Unlike centralized mechanisms, where a fixed hierarchy governs social choice, decentralized group decision-making allows agents to engage in joint deliberation. Our research focuses on the dynamics of communication and decision-making within various social choice methods. By applying different voting rules in various environments, we find that moderate decision flexibility yields better outcomes. Additionally, exploring the linguistic features of agent-to-agent conversations reveals indicators of effective collaboration, offering insights into communication patterns that facilitate or hinder collaboration. Finally, we propose various methods for determining the optimal stopping point in multi-agent collaborations based on linguistic cues. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how decentralized decision-making and group conversation shape multi-agent collaboration, with implications for the design of more effective MAS environments."},{"id":"/2024/11/18/index","metadata":{"permalink":"/ag2/talks/2024/11/18/index","source":"@site/talks/2024-11-18/index.mdx","title":"Integrating Foundation Models and Symbolic Computing for Next-Generation Robot Planning - Nov 18, 2024","description":"Speakers: Yongchao Chen","date":"2024-11-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 18, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":1.005,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Integrating Foundation Models and Symbolic Computing for Next-Generation Robot Planning - Nov 18, 2024"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Investigating Group Decision-Making Mechanism in Decentralized Multi-Agent Collaboration - Nov 25, 2024","permalink":"/ag2/talks/2024/11/25/index"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introducing FastAgency - the fastest way to bring AutoGen workflows to production - Nov 12, 2024","permalink":"/ag2/talks/2024/11/12/index"}},"content":"### Speakers: Yongchao Chen\\n\\n### Biography of the speakers:\\n\\nYongchao Chen is a PhD student of Electrical Engineering at Harvard SEAS and MIT LIDS.

By combining LLMs with symbolic planners and solvers, or guiding LLMs to generate code for planning, we enable them to address complex decision-making tasks for both real and virtual robots.

Depending on your needs, you can quickly build a REST-based web service running multiple workers or, in the case of an even larger scale, a distributed service built around a message broker protocol. The framework is powerful and uses complex technologies under the hood, yet it is simple to use and it requires only a few lines of code to get the desired results. FastAgency also has a simple-to-use component that allows you to render rich information in UI, giving you a better way to communicate with the end user. Last but not least, FastAgency allows you to import external REST APIs using their OpenAPI specifications and automatically build tools that can be attached to agents in just a few lines of code.

The stringent requirements for performance, power, area, and cost (PPAC) in modern complex designs, which can include up to billions of transistors, make hardware design increasingly demanding compared to earlier generations. These challenges result in longer turnaround times (TAT) for optimizing PPAC during RTL synthesis, simulation, verification, physical design, and reliability processes. In this talk, we introduce multi-AI agents built on top of Autogen to improve efficiency and reduce TAT in the chip design process. The talk explores the integration of novel distilled knowledge debugging graphs, task graph solving, and multimodal capabilities within multi-AI agents to address tasks such as timing debugging, Verilog debugging, and Design Rule Check (DRC) code generation. Based on these studies, multi-AI agents demonstrate promising improvements in performance, productivity, and efficiency in chip design."},{"id":"/2024/11/04/index","metadata":{"permalink":"/ag2/talks/2024/11/04/index","source":"@site/talks/2024-11-04/index.mdx","title":"Exploring Pragmatic Patterns in Agentic Systems - Nov 04, 2024","description":"Speakers: llan Bigio","date":"2024-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 4, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":0.51,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Exploring Pragmatic Patterns in Agentic Systems - Nov 04, 2024"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Multi-AI Agents for Chip Design with Distilled Knowledge Debugging Graph, Task Graph Solving, and Multi-Modal Capabilities - Nov 11, 2024","permalink":"/ag2/talks/2024/11/11/index"},"nextItem":{"title":"Agent-Model Orchestration in Multi-Agent Applications - Oct 15, 2024","permalink":"/ag2/talks/2024/10/15/index"}},"content":"### Speakers: llan Bigio\\n\\n### Biography of the speakers:\\n\\nIlan Bigio is an engineer on the Developer Experience team at OpenAI.\\n\\n### Abstract:\\n\\nAs autonomous AI systems grow increasingly sophisticated, everyone is working to identify optimal architectural patterns.

He has published papers on RL, Imitation Learning (IL), Large Language Model (LLM) agents, and optimization in multiple top AI conferences, and has served as a reviewer for top conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, CVPR, etc. For details, see https://kaiyan289.github.io/.\\n\\n### Abstract:\\n\\nRecent years have witnessed great development of AI agents. However, traditional AI, such as vanilla tree search and RL, has several limitations: inability of high-level understanding of the environment, low generalizability, and low learning efficiency. Fortunately, the advent of foundation models has enabled us to build agents that overcome all those shortcomings. With foundation models, AI agents have the potential to possess (super-)human-level reasoning, acting, and planning abilities, which are the most important features for future AI agents. In this talk, we introduce LATS (Language Agent Tree Search), the first framework that realizes all three capabilities of LLMs in reasoning, acting, and planning. Our work enables LLMs as agents to leverage tree-based search algorithms while employing LLM-powered value functions and self-reflections for cleverer exploration, which provides a more adaptive problem-solving mechanism. We show that our method is 1) empirically successful on a variety of tasks across different domains including tool-use, coding, and web agents, 2) more efficient than prior tree-search-based works, and 3) importantly, conveniently adaptable for Autogen users."}]}')}}]);
