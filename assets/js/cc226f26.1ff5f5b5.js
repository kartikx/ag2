It is a low-code tool that assists you design and visualize your multi-agent workflow in jupyter lab as a plugin. Wadiez runs over AG2 supporting all the communication patterns (e.g., sequential, nested and group chat), supporting several LLM-based services offered by OpenAI, Anthropic, NVIDIA NIM, local hosted models and several others.  In this talk, we\u2019ll dive into the powerful features of Wadiez, demonstrating its capabilities through real-world use cases.
